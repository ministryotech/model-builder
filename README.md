# Introduction
This project provides several abstract interfaces which can be used for pattern structure for Builders when constructing Models. There are variant interfaces for builders that require async methods and allowances for up to three source object parameters.

Using these interfaces ensures a common adoption of the Builder pattern between your business and model layers, making testing easier.

## Upgrading v1.1.x
